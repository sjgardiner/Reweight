These data files encode uncertainties on angular differential cross
sections for p-n, p-p, and n-n collisions. They are implemented using a
bootstrapped evaluation of the uncertainties in the offsets between the
SAID model and its constituent datasets. These are used to evaluate an
uncertainty on inelastic and charge-exchange interactions in hadron FSI.
