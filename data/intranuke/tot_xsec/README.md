This folder contains evaluations of energy-dependent nucleon fate fractions in a
format similar to data/evgen/intranuke/tot_xsec/intranuke-fractions-NA2016.dat
from the Generator repository. However, the fate fractions given here are
evaluated according to alternative hadron transport models with an approximate
mapping between the relevant reaction channels and hA2018 fates:

intranuke-fractions-NA-G4.dat = Geant4 Bertini cascade
intranuke-fractions-NA-INCL.dat = Li√®ge intranuclear cascade (INCL++)

These alternative model tables were calculated and contributed by Gray Putnam
as part of a 2025 systematic uncertainty quantification effort for SBN.
